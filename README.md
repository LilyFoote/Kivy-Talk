Our talk about kivy.

Perhaps we should use this space to outline what we want to talk about?


1: Architecture - Platform Support, PyGame, OpenGL, App class
2: Language - Explain comparison to HTML,CSS & Javascript, basic example.
3: Run a basic demo, Pong perhaps?
4: Walk through pong source & kv side by side, show relationships. Change something, run Pong again.
5: More complex example, using custom widgets - WeatherWidget and RegionMap probably.
